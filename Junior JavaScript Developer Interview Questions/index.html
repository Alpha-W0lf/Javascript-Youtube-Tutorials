    <h2>What are the data types supported by JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>primitive (numbers, booleans, strings, symbols, null, undefined), objects</p>
    <p>python: numbers (integers, floats, complex), strings, booleans, arrays, tuples, lists, dictionaries</p>

    <h2>What do break and continue statements do?</h2>
    <p>break: jumps out of a loop</p>
    <p>continue: jumps over this iteration of a loop</p>

    <h2>What's the difference between var, let, and const?</h2>
    <p>var: declares a variable. scope is usually global. can be used locally/within a function or block of code</p>
    <p>let: usually used within a function or block of code (now preferred over var even globally since it solves the problem of redeclaration inside a block of code continuing after and outside the block)</p>
    <p>const: similar to let, but immutable. cannot later be changed and can only be accessed within the block it was declared. short for "constant"</p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between null, undefined, and undeclared variables</h2>
    <p>null: variable is assigned "empty". null is a legitimate JS data type</p>
    <p>undefined: a variable can be declared, but not have an assigned value. this would be undefined</p>
    <p>undeclared: a variable must be declared in JS. if it hasn't yet been declared above, the program will have nothing to reference</p>
